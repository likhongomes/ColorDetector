# ColorDetector
## Objective
Develop software to help color blind or visually impaired individuals identify colors in their space. Providing users with these disabilities the liberty to function in a color centric environment. 
## Relevance
This project is a relevant as it will help the class develop GUI building, Object oriented design, and multithreading skills. The application will check the camera for colors. This may involve multithreading as this detection process will have to coincide with the camera. 
## Proposed contribution
Unfortunately most of the open source projects semi relevant to my idea (or blatantly the same) are not under the open source license. Even worse, a lot of the code doesn't even work. I do not see this as a roadblock to successfully launching this project. There are many library's in Swift or JavaScript that could handle color detection i.e. the Swift Framework Accelerate https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate and Javascript’s tracking.js https://trackingjs.com/examples/color_hello_world.html. Our contribution will therefore be starting an open source project to help individuals with color blindness identify color. I’m looking for a team interested in or has had experience working with iOS Mobile App development.
